# TSQL-BTree-Hashing-Project
The TSQL-BTree-Hashing-Project is designed to provide solutions to T-SQL query questions and a graphical user interface for interacting with B-Tree and various hashing algorithms. 

## Overview
This project is divided into two main parts:

### Part 1: T-SQL Queries
This part consists of answering 40 questions related to T-SQL queries. The database created for this project is included in the `database` folder.

### Part 2: B-Tree and Hashing
This part provides a graphical user interface using PySimpleGUI.The project is structured to separate the logic of B-Tree operations, hashing techniques, and the GUI, ensuring a modular and maintainable codebase. 
It allows users to:
- **B-Tree Operations**: Add, delete, or update nodes in a B-Tree.
- **Hashing Techniques**: Choose between Linear Probe, Double Hashing, Separate Chaining, and Internal Chaining to add or delete values.
